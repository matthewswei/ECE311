    "# ECE 311 Lab 3: Z-Transform and LSI Systems\n",
    "## Note: you may assume all systems are causal for this lab.\n",
    "## Due Date: 2/27 @ 11:59pm on Canvas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will explore how to work with the z-transform and apply some of the more abstract things you have learned in ECE 310 thus far. This will be a shorter lab since there will not be many applications. Let's get started with some background and review of the z-transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Z-Transform Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-transform is a linear transform that can be thought of as the discrete-time version of the Laplace transform from ECE 210. The z-transform is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(z) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty}x[n]z^{-n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-transform can be visualized on the complex-valued z-plane where the x-axis is the real part of $z$ and the y-axis is the imaginary part of $z$. Therefore, like $s$ for the Laplace transform, $z$ has a real part and imaginary part. Furthermore, it is critical that we note the Region of Convergence (ROC) for each z-transform to guarantee its uniqueness. The ROC is defined as all values of $z$ that ensure the z-transform sum converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "We frequently work with systems whose z-transform is given by a rational expression of the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(z) = \\frac{B(z)}{A(z)},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $A(z)$ and $B(z)$ are polynomials in $z^{-1}$. If we factorize the numerator and denominator, we arrive at a useful point of reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "X(z) = \\frac{\\prod_{i=1}^{N_z}(1-q_iz^{-1})}{\\prod_{j=1}^{N_p}(1-p_jz^{-1})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation, each $q_i$ is a \"zero\" of the system and each $p_j$ is a \"pole\" of the system. When an input excites a pole of the system, the output blows up to infinty and when an input touches a zero, the output goes to zero. Note that both our poles and zeros can be complex valued! We depict our poles and zeros on a \"pole-zero plot\" of the z-plane where each pole is marked by an \"x\" and each zero is marked by an \"o\". The poles of an LSI system are essential to assessing BIBO stability. For a causal LSI system, the ROC is given by $|z| > p_{\\textrm{max}}$, where $p_{\\textrm{max}}$ is the largest or outermost pole. Conversely, for a non-causal LSI system, the ROC is given by $|z| < p_{\\textrm{min}}$, the innermost or smallest pole. In either case, an LSI system is BIBO stable if and only if its ROC contains the unit circle: $|z| = 1$. Should the pole of interest lie on the unit circle, the system is marginally stable. But for this course and ECE 310, we say the system is unstable since there exists at least one bounded input that can create an unbounded output.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this lab, you may assume all systems are causal.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing we should discuss is how Linear Constant Coefficient Difference Equations (LCCDE) relate to the z-transform. Moving from an LCCDE is rather simple: we take the z-transform of both sides and remember to attach $z^-k$ for each term based on its delay argument according to the delay property of the z-transform. Below is an example of this process:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y[n] - 3y[n-1] + 2y[n-2] = 2x[n] + x[n-1]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the z-transform of both sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y(z) - 3z^{-1}Y(z) + 2z^{-2}Y(z) = 2X(z) + z^{-1}X(z)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y(z)(1-3z^{-1}+2z^{-2}) = X(z)(2+z^{-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(z) = \\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \\frac{2+z^{-1}}{1-3z^{-1}+2z^{-2}}\\cdot\\frac{z^2}{z^2} = \\frac{2z^2 +z}{z^2-3z+2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Factorizing the above rational expression would show us that we have poles at $z = 1$ and $2$ and a zero at $z = -\\frac{1}{2}$. Furthermore, this system must *not* be BIBO stable since it is causal and its largest pole lies outside the unit circle. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that while the two expressions shown in the last line are equivalent, the second one with positive exponents is more compatible with Python libaries as the scipy functions assume \"controls\" notation as opposed to our signal processing notation. For this lab, we will follow the notation that matches the scipy documentation.** We refer to the $H(z)$ shown above as the transfer function of the system. By convention a transfer function is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H(z) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}b_iz^{-i}}{1+\\sum_{j=1}^{M-1}a_jz^{-j}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first term in the denominator is a \"1\" to represent the system output not being scaled. It is important to keep these conventions in mind when utilizing Python library functions that expect them. Now that the background is done, let's try out some code."
